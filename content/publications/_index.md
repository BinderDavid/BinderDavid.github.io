- **(2020) Decomposition Diversity with Symmetric Data and Codata** Klaus Ostermann, Julian Jabs, David Binder and Ingo Skupin. *Principles of Programming Languages (POPL).*
  
  The expression problem describes a fundamental trade-off in program design: Should a program’s primary decomposition be determined by the way its domain objects are constructed (“functional” decomposition), or by the way they are destructed (“object-oriented” decomposition)? We argue that programming languages should not force one of these decompositions on the programmer; rather, a programming language should support both ways of decomposing a program in a symmetric way, with an easy translation between these decompositions. However, current programming languages are usually not symmetric and hence make it unnecessarily hard to switch the decomposition. We propose a language that is symmetric in this regard and allows a fully automatic translation between “functional” and “object-oriented” decomposition. We present a language with algebraic data types and pattern matching for “functional” decomposition and codata types and copattern matching for “object-oriented” decomposition, together with a bijective translation that turns a data type into a codata type (“destructorization”) or vice versa (“constructorization”). We present the first symmetric programming language with support for local (co)pattern matching, which includes local anonymous function or object definitions, that allows an automatic translation as described above. We also present the first mechanical formalization of such a language and prove i) that the type system is sound, that the translations between data and codata types are ii) type-preserving, iii) behavior-preserving and iv) inverses of each other. We also extract a mechanically verified implementation from our formalization and have implemented an IDE with direct support for these translations. 

### Journals

- **(2017) Popper’s Notion of Duality and His Theory of Negations** David Binder and Thomas Piecha. *History and Philosophy of Logic 38(2).*
  
  Karl Popper developed a theory of deductive logic in the late 1940s. In his approach, logic is a metalinguistic theory
  of deducibility relations that are based on certain purely structural rules. Logical constants are then characterized in
  terms of deducibility relations. Characterizations of this kind are also called inferential definitions by Popper. In this
  paper, we expound his theory and elaborate some of his ideas and results that in some cases were only sketched by him.
  Our focus is on Popper’s notion of duality, his theory of modalities, and his treatment of different kinds of negation.
  This allows us to show how his works on logic anticipate some later developments and discussions in philosophical
  logic, pertaining to trivializing (tonk-like) connectives, the duality of logical constants, dual-intuitionistic logic, the
  (non-)conservativeness of language extensions, the existence of a bi-intuitionistic logic, the non-logicality of minimal
  negation, and to the problem of logicality in general.

### Monographs

- **(2022) The Logical Writings of Karl Popper** David Binder, Thomas Piecha and Peter Schroeder-Heister (Eds.) *Volume 58 of the series "Trends in Logic".* Available as an open-access book directly via [Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-94926-6).
  
  This book is the first ever collection of Karl Popper's writings on deductive logic.
  Karl R. Popper (1902-1994) was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. His philosophy of science ("falsificationism") and his social and political philosophy ("open society") have been widely discussed way beyond academic philosophy. What is not so well known is that Popper also produced a considerable work on the foundations of deductive logic, most of it published at the end of the 1940s as articles at scattered places. This little-known work deserves to be known better, as it is highly significant for modern proof-theoretic semantics.
  This collection assembles Popper's published writings on deductive logic in a single volume, together with all reviews of these papers. It also contains a large amount of unpublished material from the Popper Archives, including Popper's correspondence related to deductive logic and manuscripts that were (almost) finished, but did not reach the publication stage. All of these items are critically edited with additional comments by the editors. A general introduction puts Popper's work into the context of current discussions on the foundations of logic. This book should be of interest to logicians, philosophers, and anybody concerned with Popper's work.

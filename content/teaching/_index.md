### Interactive Textbooks

I am interested in developing new methods to better teach computer science.
Together with Jonathan Brachth√§user and Klaus Ostermann we applied for and [Dr. K. H. Eberle Stiftung](https://dreberlestiftung.de/)

### Seminars

- **(SS18) Category Theory for Programmers** [Link to course](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ss18/cats/) (jointly with Ingo Skupin)

  This seminar introduces students to category theory, using functional programming as a guiding principle. The seminar is based on the [book of the same name](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) by Bartosz Milewski.
- **(SS19) The Little Typer** [Link to course](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ss19/tlt/)

  Dependently typed programming can be daunting and scary. In their book [The Little Typer](https://thelittletyper.com/), Daniel P. Friedman and David Thrane Christiansen introduce dependent types step by step.

### Interactive Textbooks

I am interested in developing new methods to better teach computer science.
Together with Jonathan Brachthäuser and Klaus Ostermann we applied for and [Dr. K. H. Eberle Stiftung](https://dreberlestiftung.de/)

### Seminars

- **(SS18) Category Theory for Programmers** [Link to course.](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ss18/cats/) (jointly with Ingo Skupin)

  This seminar introduces students to category theory, using functional programming as a guiding principle.
  The seminar is based on the [book of the same name](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) by Bartosz Milewski.

- **(SS19) The Little Typer** [Link to course.](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ss19/tlt/)

  Dependently typed programming can be daunting and scary.
  In their book [The Little Typer](https://thelittletyper.com/), on which this seminar is based on, Daniel P. Friedman and David Thrane Christiansen introduce dependent types step by step.

- **(WS19/20) Category Theory for Programmers** [Link to course.](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ws19/cats/) (jointly with Ingo Skupin)

  This seminar introduces students to category theory, using functional programming as a guiding principle. The seminar is based on the [book of the same name](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) by Bartosz Milewski.

- **(WS20/21) Relational Programming with miniKanren** [Link to course.](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ws20/miniKanren/)

  [MiniKanren](minikanren.org) is a minimalist programming language following the logic programming paradigm. Students learn how to solve problems in miniKanren by writing simple programs. Additionally, every student also has to write their own implementation of the miniKanren language, which allows to understand how logic programming works from the ground up.
  

- **(SS21) Functional Pearls** [Link to course.](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ss21/pearls/)

  Functional pearls are short articles which present a functional programming technique in a fun and didactic way.
  In this seminar, students each read about one functional pearl and present it to their peers.


- **(WS21/22) Abstract Machines** [Link to course.](http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ws21/am/)

  Between high-level programming languages and low-level machine models there is an intermediate category of *abstract machines*. In this seminar, students learn about abstract machines and their use in in programming language implementation and theory.

### Teaching Assistant

As a student I have been a teaching assistant for multiple years.
During that time I assisted in the teaching of lectures on lambda calculus, logic and the CS101 lecture at the university of Tübingen.

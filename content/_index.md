Welcome to my academic website. I am currently a PhD student and researcher in type theory, logic and programming languages at the University of TÃ¼bingen.
The research topics and areas I am mainly interested in are:

- Using pure functional programming techniques for solving real problems
- The duality of data types and codata types, and inductive and coinductive definitions
- The combination of multiple evaluation strategies within the same language
- Computational classical logic and the sequent calculus, and the use of the sequent calculus as a compiler intermediate language
- The theory of subtyping and its applicability to functional languages (as opposed to subtyping in object oriented languages)
- Logic and proof theoretic semantics, where I also write about the early history of inferentialist meaning theories for logic, especially in the logical writings of Karl Popper

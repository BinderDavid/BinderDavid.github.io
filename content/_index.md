Welcome to my academic page. I am a PhD student and researcher in type theory, logic and programming languages at the computer science department at the University of TÃ¼bingen.
I am mainly interested in the following research areas:

- The duality of inductive and coinductive definitions, data types and codata types.
- Computational classical logic and the sequent calculus.
- Algebraic Subtyping
- Logic and proof theoretic semantics
